Project Description:

Our app is a random number guessing game. The user will be prompted with a start button on the main screen. After starting, the app will generate a random number between 1 and x. The user will have to guess this by entering a number into a text box. If the user’s guess is correct, the app will congratulate them and choose another random number, and the user will be prompted to guess again. This will continue until the user’s guess is incorrect. No congratulating message will be displayed if the user had 0 successful guesses. After an incorrect guess, their score will be shown, and they will have the option to restart. The app will also save the user's high score, and congratulate them when they get a new high score. The user will also be able to select a difficulty mode, which will change the range of the random number selected.

Functional Requirements:
-	After opening the app, the user will see a start menu that will show the rules of the game.
-	After clicking the start button, the user will be able to select a difficulty (easy, medium or hard) by clicking on one of the corresponding buttons. This will determine the range of the random number selected.
-	The user will then be prompted to enter their guess into a text box, and then click a button to lock in that answer.
-	Both the correct number and the player’s number will be displayed and text will pop up stating whether the player guessed correctly or not.
-	If the user guess is incorrect, they will be shown a message showing that they lost. They will have the option to restart, or return to the menu.
-	If the guess is correct, the player will be prompted to enter in a new guess (this will continue until they get it wrong).
-	A counter will be on the top right corner and show how many guesses the player got correctly in a row.
-	The counter is the player's score and will be presented on the leaderboard in the menu.
-	If the user gets a high score, there will be a congratulations prompt at the end.
-	After the match (whether they lost or got a high score), the user will have the option to restart the game or return to the menu.
